<H3>Welcome!</H3>

This site is designed to promote coordination of the
Internet Routing Registry (IRR), the union of
world-wide routing policy databases that use the <A
href="/docs/rpsl.html">Routing Policy
Specification Language</A> (RPSL). We hope that other members of
the IRR community will contribute ideas, information, and news to
this new site.
<BR><BR>
This site is operated by <A
href=http://www.merit.edu>Merit Network, Inc.</A>   
Merit also operates 
the 
<A HREF="http://www.radb.net">RADB</A>
 and provides the 
<A HREF="http://www.radb.net/resources/databases.php">largest Routing
Registry mirror</A>  site on the Internet.  We're also the
developers of 
<A HREF="http://www.irrd.net">IRRd</A>, 
a widely used
database server using the RPSL
specification.
<BR><BR>
The IRR is a distributed set of databases that are individually
operated by organizations such as NTT, RIPE NCC, Savvis, Level3, etc.
The RADB is just one component of the IRR. However RADB's mission is to
mirror all component databases so as to provide the most complete view
possible of the entire IRR. Currently by querying the Merit whois
server data from 34
different databases can be found. 
<BR><BR>
Be sure to read our <A HREF="./docs/faq.html">FAQ</A> if you're
wondering whether your organization should participate in the IRR.
<BR><BR>
If you have questions about the IRR, please send email
