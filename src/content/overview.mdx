<H3>Overview of the IRR</H3>

<A NAME = "intro"><H4>Introduction</H4></A>

  The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is a distributed routing
database development effort.  Data from the Internet Routing
Registry may be used by anyone worldwide to help debug,
configure, and engineer Internet routing and addressing.
The IRR provides a mechanism for validating the contents of
BGP announcement messages or mapping an origin AS number to a list
of networks.<P>

The IRR emerged early in 1995, a time when providers worldwide were
preparing for the end of the NSFNET Backbone
Service and the birth of the commercial Internet.
A current list of databases in the IRR can be found <A

	  whois -h whois.radb.net &lt;network_IP&gt;
	  whois -h whois.radb.net AS&lt;Autonomous_System_Number&gt;
</PRE>
You can also obtain IRR data through FTP from <A
